# CODE-SUBMISSION-FORM
Hi there!
this is my very first project. and my first github repository too!!
Excited to start this new journey.

This code will store user details such as name, username, language used for coding, and screenshot of the code page in a database. It will also have a function that takes a screenshot of the user's task submitted and store it as a file, linked to the user's information in the database.

you can find my project here:
